Hi there! I'm Ein, an integrated master's student in Engineering, driven by a passion for continuous learning and staying at the forefront of digital transformation. With a strong foundation in problem-solving and project-based work in academia, I've developed a deep interest in the intersection of Data Science, Macine Learning, and Data-driven Infrastructure with a sprinkle of Full-stack Web Development and AI Engineering from side projects along the way.

Despite my engineering background, I am always working in projects in these areas of interest, taking a wide approach to a diverse range of topics. I'm actively seeking off-cycle, internship, and graduate opportunities in London.

I'm especially keen to explore analyst and research roles in the financial and technology sectors, such as Quantitative Research, Risk Management, and Software Engineering.

If you're working on something exciting, I'd love to connect!
